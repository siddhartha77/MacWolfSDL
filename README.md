# MacWolfSDL

A source port of Macintosh Wolfenstein 3D to modern platforms using SDL3.
Preserves compatibility with Third Encounter scenarios.

## Running

The Mac binary `Wolfenstein 3D` and the `Levels/` subdirectory need to be provided
from the original game install. All the necessary files can be downloaded at:
https://archive.org/details/macintosh-wolfenstein-3d-macbinary

On Windows and Linux, the resources should be placed in the same folder as the
MacWolfSDL executable. On macOS they will need to be moved inside the bundle's
`Contents/Resources` folder (this can be accessed with `Show Package Contents`
in the application's context menu). Alternatively, the resources can be placed
in the game's platform-specific data/configuration folder:

- Windows: `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\macwolfsdl\`
- macOS: `/Users/<USER>/Library/Application Support/macwolfsdl/`
- Linux: `/home/<USER>/.local/share/macwolfsdl/`

Where `<USER>` is your local username. If you're extracting the files yourself,
they can be any of these formats: MacBinary II, AppleSingle, AppleDouble, raw
resource fork.

Additional custom scenarios can be loaded using `File → Load Scenario` in the
menu, or can be placed in the `Levels/` folder just as in the original Third
Encounter release.
